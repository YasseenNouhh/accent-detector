### üîä Audio Extraction
- Extract audio from downloaded videos
- Convert to WAV format for optimal transcription
- Automatic audio processing

### üìù Audio Transcription
- **OpenAI Whisper Integration**: State-of-the-art speech recognition
- **Multiple Model Sizes**: Choose between speed and accuracy
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatically detects 99+ languages
- **Multiple Input Methods**: 
  - Transcribe audio from downloaded videos
  - Upload audio files directly
  - Process existing audio files
- **Rich Output**: 
  - View transcription in the web interface
  - Download as text file with timestamps
  - Detailed segment-by-segment breakdown

### üéØ Accent Detection
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Hugging Face's `superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er` with fallback feature-based detection
- **Multiple English Accents**: Detects General American, British (RP), Australian, Irish, Scottish, Canadian, South African
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides percentage confidence for predictions
- **Smart Preprocessing**: Automatically converts audio to optimal format (16kHz mono)
- **Quality Checks**: Validates audio duration and volume levels
- **Robust Fallback**: Uses audio feature analysis if AI model fails
- **Detailed Results**: 
  - Primary accent prediction with confidence score
  - Top 5 accent predictions
  - Technical analysis details
  - Downloadable results file

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd accent-detector
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: The app uses `faster-whisper` for transcription, which is more compatible with different systems than `openai-whisper`.

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Whisper Model Comparison

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Use Case |
|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| `tiny` | ~39 MB | Fastest | Basic | Quick transcription, low-quality audio |
| `base` | ~74 MB | Fast | Good | **Recommended balance** |
| `small` | ~244 MB | Medium | Better | Higher accuracy needs |
| `medium` | ~769 MB | Slow | High | Professional transcription |
| `large` | ~1550 MB | Very Slow | Best | Maximum accuracy required |

## Supported Formats

### Video Input
- Loom videos
- Direct MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM links
- YouTube videos (limited)

### Audio Input
- WAV, MP3, MP4, M4A, FLAC, OGG

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Whisper Not Available**
   ```bash
   pip install faster-whisper
   ```

2. **Slow Transcription**
   - Use smaller models (tiny/base)
   - Install GPU-accelerated PyTorch
   - Ensure sufficient RAM

3. **Download Issues**
   - For Loom: Right-click video ‚Üí "Copy Video Address"
   - Use direct video URLs when possible
   - Check internet connection

4. **Audio Extraction Fails**
   - Video might not have audio track
   - Try different video source
   - Check video file integrity

5. **Accent Detection Issues**
   - Ensure audio is clear English speech
   - Minimum 1 second duration required
   - Check internet connection for model downloads

### Performance Tips

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Install CUDA-compatible PyTorch for 5-10x faster transcription
2. **Model Selection**: Use `base` model for best speed/accuracy balance
3. **Audio Quality**: Higher quality audio = better transcription accuracy
4. **File Size**: Larger audio files take longer to process
